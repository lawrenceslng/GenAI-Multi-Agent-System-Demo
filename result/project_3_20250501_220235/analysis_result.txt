  "main_objective": "Create an intelligent content curation agent that automatically gathers, analyzes, and summarizes trending articles from multiple online sources to generate a daily digest for users.",
  "creative_idea": {
    "summary": "Develop a multi-functional agent that uses custom Python tools to scrape news websites, filter articles based on relevance and popularity, and then utilize an MCP server with Playwright to automate browser interactions for dynamic content extraction. The agent then summarizes the curated articles and compiles a personalized daily newsletter.",
    "why_interesting": "This approach combines static data processing with dynamic web automation, showcasing how agents can handle real-world, multi-step tasks. It demonstrates integration of multiple MCP servers and tools, illustrating a practical application of multi-agent systems in content aggregation and summarization, which is both innovative and highly relevant."
