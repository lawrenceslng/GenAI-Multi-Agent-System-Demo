Part 1 - Functions as Tools

Build a tool calling Agent using LlamaIndex that consists of at least 3 python functions or methods as tools. You can, for example, create a data structure and operations on the data structure (like a tree). Or, you can pick a Python Library, like os or shutils and expose methods as operations. Show how the Agent can use the tools to solve a problem or perform a task with the tools.
Part 2 - MCP

Pick one or more MCP Servers that to build an Agent that can interact with a more sophisticated tool, like the MCP Playwright tool. See the following page for a list of possible MCP Servers:

Part 3 - Build a Useful Agent or Multi-Agent System

Combining what you learned in Part 1 and Part 2, pick a more ambitious problem to solve. See how far you can get with your Agent.

Another option to build out a multi-agent system.

Be creative.
