  "main_objective": "Create an intelligent multi-tool agent that automates the process of researching, summarizing, and visualizing data from multiple online sources to generate comprehensive reports.",
  "creative_idea": {
    "summary": "Develop an agent that leverages LlamaIndex to integrate three custom Python functions: (1) fetch_web_content(url), (2) extract_key_points(text), and (3) generate_visualizations(data). The agent interacts with an MCP server hosting a web automation tool (like Playwright) to navigate websites, gather data, and produce visual summaries, culminating in a polished report.",
    "why_interesting": "This approach combines data retrieval, natural language processing, and web automation into a cohesive system, demonstrating multi-modal capabilities. It showcases how agents can perform complex, real-world tasks like research automation, making it both practical and innovative."
